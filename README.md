# mindfa: The implementation of Hopcroft's algorithm in Go

The implementation of [DFA minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization) using Hopcroft's algorithm in Go. The time complexity is O(n log n) and the memory complexity is O(n)(n is the number of the states of the input DFA).
